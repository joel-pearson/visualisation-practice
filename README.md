Visualisation Practice using current COVID-19 data

---

The purpose of this project is to practice data visualisation techniques for my personal development.

The data used for this project was taken from the World Health Organization (WHO) website, which can be found at this [link](https://covid19.who.int/). 
The website provides access to data records that show the number of daily cases and deaths reported to the WHO globally, as well as the recorded vaccination data. 

This script has been made very adaptable in order to be used for future data from the same source.
