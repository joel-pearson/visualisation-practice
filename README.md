Visualisation Practice using current COVID-19 data

---

The purpose of this project is to practice data visualisation techniques for my personal development.

The data used for this project was taken from the World Health Organization (WHO) website, which can be found at this [link](https://covid19.who.int/). 
The website provides access to data records that show the number of daily cases and deaths reported to the WHO globally, as well as the recorded vaccination data. 

The script downloads data from the WHO website so is always displaying the most up-to-date statistics. If not internet connection, it will use the older file found in the directory.
